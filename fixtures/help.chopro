[Intro]
[Bm]
[Bm]Help, I need some[Bm/A]body
[G]Help, nothing any[G/F#]body
[E]Help, you know I need someone,
[A]Help !

[Verse 1 :] 
[A]When I was young and so much [C#m]younger than today
[F#m]I never needed anybody's [D]help, in [G]any [A]way
But now these  days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors.

{soc}
[Bm]Help me if you can, I'm feeling down, 
and I do[G] appreciate you being 'round
[E]Help me get my feet back on the ground, 
won't you [A]please, please, help me ?
{eoc}

[Verse 2 :]
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways
My independance seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I, just need you like, I've never done before.

{soc}
{eoc}

[Verse 1 😴]

{soc}
{eoc}

[Outro]
Help [F#m]me!  Help [A]me !__________[A6]Oo.
