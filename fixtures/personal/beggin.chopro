[Intro🎙️:]
Put your loving hand out, baby
'Cause I'm beggin'
[Bm]
{soc}
[Bm G C#m7 F#7]I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'
{eoc}
[Verse 1 :]
[Bm G C#m7 F#7]
Ridin' high, when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you want me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end
{comment:Que Max}
So, any time I need ya, let me go
Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No
Any time I see you, let me know
But I planted that seed, just let me grow
I'm on my knees while I'm beggin
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey yeah, ratatata

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 :]
I need you to understand {soh}(Début sans accord){eoh}
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again
 
An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man, but I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

[Verse 3 :]
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on
Keep opening doors 
Keep hoping for
That the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home
Girl, I'm beggin'
 
[Chorus]
 
[Verse 4 :] 
I'm fightin' hard {soh}(Début sans accord){eoh}
To hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on
I can't fall back
I'm just a con about to fade to black
 
[Outro]
