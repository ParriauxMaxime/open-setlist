{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Gm]We all came out to Montreux
On the [F]Lake Geneva [Gm]shoreline
[Gm]To make records with a mobile
[F]We didn't have much [Gm]time
[Gm]Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were [F]at the best place a[Gm]round
[Gm]But some stupid with a flare gun
[F]Burned the place to the [Gm]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus}
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water, [Gm]a fire in the sky
[C]Smoke on the [Ab]water [Gm]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Gm]They burned down the gambling house
It [F]died with an awful [Gm]sound
[Gm]Funky Claude was running in and out
[F]Pulling kids out the [Gm]ground
[Gm]When it all was over
We [F]had to find another [Gm]place
[Gm]But Swiss time was running out
It [F]seemed that we would lose the [Gm]race
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Gm]We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was [F]empty, cold and [Gm]bare
[Gm]But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside
[F]Making our music [Gm]there
[Gm]With a few red lights, a few old beds
We [F]made a place to [Gm]sweat
[Gm]No matter what we get out of this
I [F]know, I know we'll never for[Gm]get
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{comment: Guitar solo over verse chords, then repeat chorus to end}
