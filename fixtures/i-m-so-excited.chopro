[Intro :]
[Gm]  [Cm7]  [Eb]  [Bbsus4]  [Bb]      [x2]

[Verse :]
To[Gm]night's the night we're gonna[Cm7] make it happen
To[Eb]night we'll put all other [Bbsus4]things [Bb]aside
Give [Gm]in this time and show [Cm7]me some affection
We're [Eb]going for those pleasures [Bbsus4]in [Bb]the night
 
[Pre-Chorus :]
I want [Am]to love you, feel [Gm]you, wrap [Dm7]myself around you
I want [Am]to squeeze you, [Gm]please you, I just can't get enough
And if [Cm]you move [Dm]real slow I'll [F]let it go

{soc}
I'm so [Gm]excited, and I just [Eb]can't hide it
[Eb]I'm about to lose [F]control and I [Gm]think I like it
I'm so excited, and I just can't hide it
And I know, I know, I know, I know I know I want you
{eoc}

[Verse 2 :]
We shouldn’t even think about tomorrow
Sweet memories will last a long, long time
We’ll have a good time baby, don’t you worry
And if we’re still playing ‘round, boy that’s just fine
