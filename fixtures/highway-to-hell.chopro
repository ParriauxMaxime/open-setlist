[Verse 1]
Living easy, living free
Season ticket on a one-way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everything in my stride

Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing that I would rather do
Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be [E]there too

{sot}
[A] - -  [D/A][G][D/F#] 
{eot}
{soc}
I'm on the highway to hell...
{eoc}

[Verse 2]
No stop signs, speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel, gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me round

Hey Satan, payed my dues
Playing in a rocking band
Hey Momma, look at me
I'm on my way to the promised land
